Week 5 Homework:

* Using Twitter API: __Muhammed Gülcü__
What type of data is provided with that API? (JSON, what is it?)
Are there any other easier ways of reaching that API in Python? (Use twython for example)
By using twython package, can you show us how to filter data according to a given criteria.
(location, language, day time, context...)

  * http://pandas.pydata.org/  (class pandas.DataFrame(data=None, index=None, columns=None, dtype=None, copy=False)
  Two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).    
  Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects.   The primary pandas data structure)
